<p>In this assignment you are going to program a distributed application to 
  crack passwords! Using more cores or computers should make the program run faster.</p>
<p>The goal is to get a large speed-up: That is to see how much faster you can make the program run, compared to the centralized (non-distributed) version of the program.</p>
<p>The general idea is that you have a password file with (username, encrypted 
  password). The encryption algorithm has no known decryption algorithm.</p>
<p>You also have a large dictionary (list of words) that users <em>might</em> have used 
  as passwords. You must encrypt all the words in the dictionary and compare the 
  encrypted word to the encrypted passwords from the password file. If you have a 
  match, you have found a password, now in clear text.</p>
<p>Some users might not use an exact word from the dictionary, but may have made 
  some kind of change to the words (transformations), like</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting with a capital letter </li>
  <li>All capital letters </li>
  <li>Any arbitrary number of capital letter of the beginning of the word </li>
  <li>Adding 1 or 2 digits to the beginning of the word </li>
  <li>Adding 1 or 2 digits to the end of the word </li>
  <li>any combination of the above. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are given some examples of the changes from above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>secret </li>
  <li>Secret </li>
  <li>SECRET </li>
  <li>SECret </li>
  <li>5secret </li>
  <li>secret3 </li>
  <li>Secret123 </li>
</ul>
<p>As can be seen from this list <a href="http://splashdata.com/press/PR121023.htm"> http://splashdata.com/press/PR121023.htm</a> many users chose passwords which 
  are more or less takes from a dictionary.</p>
<p>In this assignment the general idea must be implemented using a number of 
  distributed architectures.</p>
<ul>
  <li>master/slave </li>
  <li>pipeline </li>
</ul>
<p>Each architecture can be implemented using threads (useful if the computer 
  has more than one CPU) and by using processes with socket for communication.</p>
<h2>Master/slave (data parallelism)</h2>
<p>The master holds the dictionary. Each slave gets a part of the dictionary.</p>
<h2>Pipeline (task parallelism)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>First task in pipeline reads from the dictionary file and sends the 
    words on to the next process. </li>
  <li>Next task make a list of all changes of the dictionary word (the 
    different transformations)</li>
  <li>Next task encrypts the  all words. </li>
  <li>Next task compares the encrypted word to the encrypted passwords from 
    the password file. </li>
  <li>Last task writes the cracked user's username + password to the screen 
    (or to a file) </li>
</ol>
<h2>A number of different architectures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Master / Slave where the master and the slaves are running in separated thread. They can use shared memory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Master / Slave where the master and the slaves are running in separated processes, e.g. on different computers communicating over TCP sockets.<br>
    This comes in two variations:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The master is the server. The slaves are clients.</li>
      <li>The master is a client. The slaves are servers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Pipeline where each "process" is running in a separate thread. The share memory</li>
  <li>Master / Slave with web services.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<li>

  <h2>Group work</h2>
  <p>The assignment must be done in groups. Teachers have formed the groups and 
    review groups.</p>
  <p>Each group must make an experiment of one main architecture. Teachers 
    have decided 
    which architecture each group have to experimented with. Depending on the groups 
    motivation and time they can chose a supplementary architecture to implement 
    after the main architecture has been finished.</p>
  <p>The groups are as follow:</p>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="5">

      <li>Some of the groups might like to sit elsewhere in building no 1. Please inform the teacher where you are, if not in the classroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>To get you started you must download a <a href="http://laerer.rhs.dk/andersb/sodpcs/passwordcracking/PasswordCrackerCentralized.zip"> centralized version of the password 
      cracker</a></p>
    <p>Run it - and see how much time it uses running on your computer(s).</p>
    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>The Visual Studio project includes a dictionary.</p>
    <p>You are allowed to try other dictionaries.</p>
    <h2>Password file</h2>
    <p>The Visual Studio project includes a password file. Each line in the file contains 
      username + encrypted password.</p>
    <p>The encrypted passwords are encoded using BASE64 encoding to make them into 
    text strings storeable in a text file.</p>
